    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    " - Gaussian Naive Bayes is arguably one of the most featured model for text classification tasks. On a second thought, any classification task where the feature space is infinite (e.g. images). In Verizon, we used it to classify the searches done by our consumers on the website. It is also widely used for sentiment analysis on textual data.\n",
    " - Naive Bayes is known to perform fast because of the simplicity of the model, so it can be used for real time predictions. As it is \"naive\" in nature i.e. treats the occurence of features as independent of each other, with proper encoding, like TfIdf, it tends to neglect the weak features.\n",
    " - The reason it is \"simple\", implicitly makes it a high bias model. This is the reason it tends to have low training performance metric scores compared to other classification algorithms. Also, the fact that it considers the features independent of each other doesn't reflect the real life scenario of use cases making it a bad estimator.\n",
    " - As the features look independent of each other and should have low correlation between them (I didn't plot a heatmap though as it is out of scope of this course, till now atleast), I suspected GaussianNB to be a good enough estimator. Even though the target is imbalanced, there are more than 11k rows to help the algorithm converge, diminishing the issue Naive Bayes could have with less data.\n",
    " - _Reference_: https://towardsdatascience.com/all-about-naive-bayes-8e13cef044cf\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Decision Tree:\n",
    " - Decision Trees are used across domains for a multitude of tasks such as customer churn prediction, loan defaulter prediction in banking, decision predicion in medical field, etc. In telecom, it has been and being used for survival analysis, upgrade prediction and so on.\n",
    " - Decision trees tend to fit on data quiet well and are fairly simple to train compared to other sophisticated ML algortihms. These are quite interpretable because of which creating audit trail for ML predictions is achievable.\n",
    " - As Decision Trees are high variance model, if the hyperparameters aren't chosen with due diligence they tend to overfit on training data (rather memorizing it) and perform bad on training data.\n",
    " - As the census data is for an year, the chances of data drift is quite bleak. This is the reason why I chose this algorithm as a possible classifier. The rationale was that if the algorithm fits on training data quiet well, the patterns in testing data would be quite similar leading the model to make good predictions.\n",
    " - _Reference_: https://medium.com/@dhiraj8899/top-5-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-decision-tree-algorithm-428ebd199d9a\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Support Vector Machine:\n",
    " - SVM based classifiers are used for text classification, image classification, handwriting recognition etc. In telecom, they are used to predict network outages as the kernel trick tends to find out patterns not recognizable by other algorithms.\n",
    " - As SVM uses hyperplanes to draw the boundary across classes, it is arguably the best classifier algorithm when the classes are seperable. It works great with high number of features. As it is affected only by support vectors, the outliers impact quite less to the algorithm's convergence.\n",
    " - It takes quite some time to converge on larger dataset and cannot perform well when classes aren't seperable. Specifically, the choice and combination of hyperparameters can be quite tricky in SVMs.\n",
    " - As the number of features are just 13, which is quite less from a ML algorithm standpoint, the convergence of SVM based classifier can be very fast. Also, I expect it to learn patterns in higher dimensions which isn't possible in other algorithms.\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "From a performance metric standpoint, out of the three classifiers chosen SVM tends to work the best. If we look at the training time & testing time accuracy scores and F-scores, Naive Bayes tend to underfit on the data. This is because both the training time scores and testing time scores are lower than that of other two. On the other hand, if we look at the Decision Tree metrics it is quite apparent, because of near perfect scores, that the model has learned the data in all the three samples provided to it. This is a classic case of overfitting and it wouldn't perform well on the testing dataset, which is brought about in the graphs for testing set. On the other hand, SVC's accuracy score is lurking around in the range of 0.8 and F-score in the range of 0.6. According to the tuning section of the supervised learning chapter of this course this makes it a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training time of Support Vector Machine based classifier is significantly higher than it's peers for all 1%, 10%, and 100% of the samples. This is a similar trend being followed while model predictions are done using all the three classifiers. However, ~140 seconds for training close to 34k rows of 103 features (after encoding) isn't quite bad on a processor of this configuration: *system='Linux', node='0817487abf7d', release='4.15.0-1052-gcp', version='#56-Ubuntu SMP Thu Dec 19 10:54:56 UTC 2019', machine='x86_64', processor='x86_64'* If the use case would have been to expose the predictions as a service, SVM based model would have performed quiet poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As most of the features are one-hot encoded (for categorical values), the range space of values in those columns has decreased significantly. As the data would have become more seperable by this, I am hoping this would have made it possible for the SVM with default parameters to find a convergence point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a SVM seems to be the best choice amongst all of choice."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "In order to find the donors for the cause, the need was to find people in the region who earn more than $50,000/year to whom notifications could be sent to request to donate for the causes. As per the need of the task given, you (CharityML) can afford to miss people earning more, but cannot err by sending notifications to people earning less than the threshold amount. For such precise decisions, I needed to see other profile related attributes of people belonging to both of these stratas. After collecting a lot of data from volunteers, I analyzed these attributes correlation with the outcome, i.e. if a person earns more than $50K or not. This made me boil the number of attributes to 13 which could predict this outcome with a plausible certainty. This is good both in terms of the tehcnicalities behind a statistical model and to know why a certain prediction has come out of that model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform such a classification task, there are various tools at my disposal. I chose the top 3 of such models to see which performs the best with the data at hand. Here, the model unergo a critical process called as training. At this stage, the parameters of the function is automatically learnt by the algorithm by reiterating on a subset of data chosen beforehand. The other subset of data is kept to test the predictions of the trained model. This function actually defines the relationship between the attributes of persons in consideration and the the fact that if they earn more than $50K or not. These models are essentially different functions to predict this relationship. In our case, a \"Support Vector Machine Clasifier\" performed the best in learning the patterns for these subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model learns the exact function to predict the outcome, it is tested against the other subset of data held out for this purpose. It checks the values of all of these attributes for each person and tries to predict if the person earns more than the threshold or not. This is inline with what it learnt during the training phase. The SVM classifier performed quite well without any manual intervention to alter its default parameters."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
